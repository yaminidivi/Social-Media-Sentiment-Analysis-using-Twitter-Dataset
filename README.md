# Twitter Sentiment Analysis: Leveraging NLP and Deep Learning for Social Insights

# Introduction:
This project focuses on analyzing sentiments expressed in Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. By harnessing the power of data science, we aim to gain valuable insights into social sentiments, particularly pertaining to airline experiences.

# Description:
This repository contains code for a comprehensive sentiment analysis pipeline tailored for Twitter data. We start by importing necessary packages for data manipulation, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

# Data Preparation:
The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from Twitter, comprising tweets and corresponding sentiment labels. We clean and preprocess the text data by removing stopwords and mentions, ensuring that the input to our models is optimized for analysis.

# Model Development:
The project implements various deep learning models for sentiment classification, ranging from baseline architectures to models with regularization and dropout layers. Through experimentation, we assess the performance of each model in accurately predicting sentiment labels.

# Evaluation and Testing:
To evaluate model performance, we conduct rigorous testing on separate test sets, measuring accuracy and loss metrics. The results provide insights into the effectiveness of different model architectures in capturing and predicting sentiment from Twitter data.

# Conclusion:
This project serves as a practical demonstration of how NLP and ML techniques can be applied to analyze social media sentiments effectively. By leveraging Twitter data, we aim to contribute to a better understanding of public sentiments, particularly in the context of airline experiences.
